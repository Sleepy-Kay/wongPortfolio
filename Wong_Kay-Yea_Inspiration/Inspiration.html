       <p>Hello! My name is Kay</p>

       <p>I'm passionate about design so here are these inspirations that help me go through my process and art!</p>

         <h3><em>Gharliera</em></h3>
           <p>An artist I've been following since my freshmen year of high school is an artist named Gharliera. A Korean digital artist who creates beautiful women in Japanese-style cyber-punk clothing. Many of his works are aesthetic, beautifully grotesque, and pretty much badass.</p>

        <h3><em>Eve</em></h3>
          <p>He makes it a whole mission to keep his face a mystery and produces such musical pieces that also have the craziest ongoing story that he's also written. Many of the days I spend listening to his music while I go to school, draw, or even gaming. He keeps me awake and honestly, I couldn't thank him more for also writing lyrics that I almost always relate to.</p>

        <h3><em>Danganronpa</em></h3>
         <p>A franchise that recently ended is a horror mystery visual novel in which you get to play a character who solves cases. It's such a big influence in my life discovering this game series and I couldn't thank it more for also influencing who I am today. Also because of the fact of how wacky each character can be but how beautiful the art can be. The art can be described as pop-up 2d art with it also having a splash of horror aspects of "who did it?"</p>
